This project is a fully functional Python application that automates attendance tracking for campus or community events. It uses structured data, loops, functions, and error handling to create a reliable system that records sign-ins, removes entries, displays attendance, and saves a professional report. The goal is to demonstrate how programming supports real-world service-learning needs by improving organization and reducing human error.

🧩 Features

Add attendees (name, major, year)

Remove attendees

Display full attendance list

View event details

Save attendance report to a file

Menu-driven interface

Built-in error handling for invalid input

🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated

While loops

Error handling (try/except)

File handling

Input validation

Debugging and structured programming

🤖 AI Concept Connections

This project connects to foundational AI concepts such as:

Automated processing of structured data

Decision-making logic (menu-driven branching)

Data validation similar to ML input checks

Automating tasks normally done by humans

📘 Reflection Summary

This project strengthened my understanding of how programming can support real-world community tasks. By designing a menu-based system with automated data handling, I learned the importance of clean logic, structured data, and user-friendly design. I also saw how these concepts relate to AI through automation, decision-making steps, and error prevention. Completing this project improved my ability to design, test, debug, and present meaningful software.
